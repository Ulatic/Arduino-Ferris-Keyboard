# Arduino-Ferris-Keyboard
Arduino Code for Ferris-Sweep-Tweaked

Hi,
I build one of those: https://github.com/benvallack/Ferris-Sweep-Tweaked
But i didn't find software and used a cheap Arduino Pro Micro instead of some fancy USBC uC :)
So here is my code for it. I have to admit, the FSM stuff I found somewere online. But the Array stuff i did by myself.
Choose Arduino Leonardo for uploading in the Arduino IDE.
Have Fun
